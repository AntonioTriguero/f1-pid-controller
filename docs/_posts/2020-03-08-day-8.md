This new update aims to improve the speed of the algorithm of the previous post. For this we intend to relate the error to the velocity and obtain a method that allows to vary the velocity. For this task a new component will be created with a new driver formula specific to speed. In addition to this, it will be necessary to change the image processing to obtain more useful information for this task.

## New image processing

The processing is the same as before but this time you get one more point pair: two centers of the red line at different heights. The objective is to obtain one point above the one taken as reference to calculate the error and another one below it. In this way you always have a point that looks farther away than the current one and another one that looks closer. The first one will be used to detect when you are going to enter a curve and the second one to know when you are going to exit a curve, thus regulating the speed. 

As a result, two more points are obtained and an image where all these points are drawn.

## Speed control function

The speed control function is defined by the following formula:

<div style="display: flex; padding-bottom: 25px">
  <img src="{{site.site_url}}/assets/equations/v-equation.png" width="40%" style="margin: auto">
</div>

In this formula the developer is responsible for initializing two parameters: Vmax and Kv. The first one allows you to define the velocity on straight lines, i.e. when the error is zero. The second one allows you to define the amount of error to be used to calculate the formula. Not to be confused with the rotation error as in this case it is a new error formula that follows the following expression:

<div style="display: flex; padding-bottom: 25px">
  <img src="{{site.site_url}}/assets/equations/v-error.png" width="85%" style="margin: auto">
</div>

In this expression it is intended to calculate the error (only in the horizontal component) of the two additional line centers with respect to the center of the line taken as reference and add them together. In this way it is intended to see if the three points are aligned. The more aligned they are, the smaller the error and therefore the closer the resulting speed will be to the maximum speed, and the more misaligned they are, the more the speed will decrease. With this formula the car can progressively reduce speed when approaching or exiting a curve. It also allows to regulate the speed during the curve making the task of initializing the parameters Kp and Kd, explained in previous posts, easier.
