For this post I intend to show a first proportional controller whose objective is to run the circuit following the line at a constant speed and without taking into account the speed but the accuracy and safety of driving.

## Algorithm

The algorithm is based on an infinite loop in which each iteration executes three main tasks sequentially:

1. Capture of an image of the current state and processing of the same.
2. Obtaining the rotational speed for this state.
3. Order this information to the motors.

Optionally, although highly recommended, the system allows to display an image at the end of each iteration. This image may contain
the captured image together with certain elements that indicate how the image has been processed (color segmentation, drawing, etc).

### Image processing

In order to extract information of value for the algorithm, it is necessary to process the image. This processing will be done with a Python module called OpenCV, well known in the world of computer vision. This module is already included in the Robotics Academy tool both in Unibotics (web) and locally.

In this first version it has been decided to obtain two data from the image:
- Center of the red line given a height.
- Center of the image given a height.

In this case it is of interest to obtain both measurements given the same height in order to be able to run the error function later. Obtaining the center of the image given a height can be obtained trivially using Numpy and OpenCV so I proceed to explain how the center of the line at a given height has been obtained.

#### Center of the red line given a height

The advantage of this problem within the Gazebo simulator is that the line is red all along its path and there is no additional red element within the environment. In this way it is possible to perform a segmentation by color and obtain an image with all the red elements inside the image. This can be easily done in OpenCV with the function [`inRange()`](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/da/d97/tutorial_threshold_inRange.html). Since the range of BGR values is not trivial to perform the segmentation, we proceeded to develop a tool that allows to select those values with a graphical interface in OpenCV while observing the result. 

<div style="display: flex">
  <img src="{{site.site_url}}/assets/images/color-segmentation.png" width="75%" style="margin: auto">
</div>

#### Result

This procedure provides as a result the coordinates of the center points of the image and the center of the red line at the same height and a copy of the image received as input that has drawn these two points (green for the center of the image and blue for the other). This image will be used for the following steps.

### Obtaining the rotation parameter

For this task it is necessary an error function, which will be explained later, on which the parameters are calculated. Once the error is calculated, the parameters are calculated. For this there are different strategies and in this case we will use the simplest one, which is a P-controller:

<div style="display: flex; padding-bottom: 25px">
  <img src="{{site.site_url}}/assets/equations/p-equation.png" width="30%" style="margin: auto">
</div>

In this formula the parameter Kp has an initial value that the programmer must initialize properly. Normally this parameter is found out by experimentation and ends the amount of error that will be taken into account to calculate the next value. In this way, the greater the error, the greater the amount of error that will be taken and therefore the greater the change in P. If this is applied to one of the parameters, in this case the rotation speed, this would mean that the greater the error, the greater the rotation speed will be to one side or the other, trying to make the error zero.

#### The error function

The formula of a P controller is always the same, so the complexity of the algorithm lies in choosing and implementing the error function. In this case the error function follows the following formula: 

<div style="display: flex; padding-bottom: 25px">
  <img src="{{site.site_url}}/assets/equations/p-error.png" width="30%" style="margin: auto; ">
</div>

The distance of the center of the line with respect to the center of the image is calculated. This distance can be negative or positive. This gives us the possibility to have the intuition whether a curve is approaching in left (negative) or right (positive) direction to the position where the car is located and to correct accordingly the turning parameter by means of the P function.

### Result 

As a result of this process we obtain an implementation of the error function, another one of the P function and as a result of the execution we have the turning parameter corresponding to the image obtained as input.
