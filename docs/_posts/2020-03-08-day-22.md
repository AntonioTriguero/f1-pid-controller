In this chapter we intend to introduce triangulation and its geometrical application to estimate points in space based on a stereo vision system. There are different methods to triangulate but the chosen one is the one that adapts more to the rest of the techniques chosen to solve the problem.

## Geometric triangulation

Triangulation aims to find the closest point to two intersecting or cutting lines. If they intersect, it will be the point of intersection between the lines, but if they cross, it will be the midpoint of the line that cuts perpendicularly to the two lines. This line will be defined by the vector product of the director vectors of the given lines, which results in a vector perpendicular to both vectors, and an initial point that can be located on the first line or on the second, but this will not be necessary as we will see later.
Once we have this line perpendicular to both, we can pose a series of equations that have to be fulfilled. In this case the equation that arises is that a displacement made on the vector of one of the lines plus a displacement made on the perpendicular vector is equal to a displacement on the other line. This can be seen more easily in the following equation:

<div style="display: flex; padding-bottom: 25px">

</div>

As can be seen, each line would be represented as an unknown scalar (a, c) multiplied by a vector plus an initial point (p1, p2) and the displacement on the perpendicular vector as a scalar (b) multiplied by this vector. It is not necessary to add the initial point component since we start from the resulting position on the displacement of the line r1.
This equation would lead to a system of equations with three unknowns (a, b, c) with three equations clearing the equation and remaining as follows:

<div style="display: flex; padding-bottom: 25px">
  <img src="{{site.site_url}}/assets/equations/triangulation-system.png" width="40%" style="margin: auto">
</div>

We have three equations since the vectors are in space R3 and therefore have three components which would translate into a matrix of coefficients of 3x3, if the previous equation is developed.
With this system we can already estimate these three variables and to find the midpoint between the two lines it is enough to move by r1 the displacement marked by a and move half of b by the perpendicular vector following the following equation:

<div style="display: flex; padding-bottom: 25px">
  <img src="{{site.site_url}}/assets/equations/triangulation-result.png" width="40%" style="margin: auto">
</div>

This method would allow us to obtain the midpoint between two straight lines and can be extrapolated to the problem posed by back projection rays, but with certain nuances that will be discussed below.

## Stereo triangulation

Starting from the previously explained triangulation method, in order to apply it, two straight lines will be necessary. In this case these lines will be defined by the back projection rays of homologous pixels. These rays are defined as a scalar by a director vector plus an initial point which in this case is the position of the corresponding camera. To find the line perpendicular to both, it is enough to calculate the vector product of the ray vectors and the triangulation method can be applied.
For this case we have chosen to find the coefficient matrix and the baseline and using the least squares method offered by numpy (np.linalg.lstsq()) we can solve the system and find the estimate of the point in the scene reference system. This procedure is applied for each pair of counterparts to obtain a three-dimensional reconstruction of the scene.
