In the previous post we have already explained the general operation of the algorithm and in this article we intend to explain an improvement of it. This improvement will be directed to modify the P controller to add a PD controller. The image processing will be the same and the results will be the same but the aim is to develop a more stable and safer driver.

## New driver formula

The formula that is developed to find the rotational speed is as follows:

<div style="display: flex; padding-bottom: 25px">
  <img src="{{site.site_url}}/assets/equations/pd-equation.png" width="40%" style="margin: auto">
</div>

In this case the variable Kd is added which operates on the derivative of the error. In this case the parameter Kd performs the same task as Kp but in this case on the amount of the derivative of the error at instant t. To find the derivative of the error, the following formula is used:

<div style="display: flex; padding-bottom: 25px">
  <img src="{{site.site_url}}/assets/equations/pd-error.png" width="40%" style="margin: auto">
</div>

In this way we can interpret the derivative as the variation of the error with respect to the previous frame. Following this interpretation, the greater the variation, the greater the correction will be. The direction of the derivative must also be taken into account, since the derivative component is intended to ensure that the turns are not abrupt and that the model does not oscillate around the zero of the error. This will allow to correct the direction of the car when exiting the curves more quickly and to take the curves more smoothly as long as there is a harmony between the parameters Kp and Kd.

## Testing

After testing with this change for a number of iterations in which the Kp and Kd parameters are modified, it can be seen that both parameters work quite accurately when they have similar values and the speed of the car is not very high. In the case of increasing the speed too much the car will oscillate too much, due to the derivative of the error, and it will end up losing control even before reaching the first curve. On the other hand if Kp is significantly lower than Kd the car will not react when entering the curves because the proportional component (Kp) is the one that gives the car that fast reaction capacity while the derivative component (Kd) is intended to stabilize the steering wheel at error 0.
