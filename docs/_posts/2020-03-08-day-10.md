In this new post we intend to show the final version of the controller. For this, the new integral variable is introduced, which allows to give importance to the error when it accumulates during many iterations. This will allow the car to be more stable when cornering.

## New formula

The formula for updating the angular velocity is similar to the previous one but introducing the integral variable:

<div style="display: flex; padding-bottom: 25px">
  <img src="/assets/equations/pid-equation.png" width="65%" style="margin: auto">
</div>

In this case the parameter Ki is introduced to give weight to the integral. It must be taken into account that we are talking about an integral calculated numerically. This means that it will be calculated as the sum of all the previous errors:

<div style="display: flex; padding-bottom: 25px">
  <img src="/assets/equations/pid-error.png" width="35%" style="margin: auto">
</div>

Thanks to this formula we have an approximation of the integral in t iterations.

## Results

When adding this new variant to the algorithm it must be taken into account that since it is an "error accumulation" the variable Ki cannot have a value equal or greater than Kp and Kd, otherwise the car would not be centered on the straights. On the other hand it has been a good idea to incorporate this variant as it avoids swerving both in the curves and when exiting them. It causes a smoother ride.
